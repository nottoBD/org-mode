# Hit C-c C-c to execute.

# Improvements:
# - Ranged Deadlines: Use DEADLINE: <date>--<date> for multi-day spans (Org supports this for agenda warnings across range).
# - Effort/Categories: For better agenda filtering (e.g., by :CATEGORY:).
# - More Drills: Examples with cloze, multisided.
# - Clocking: Use I/O in agenda or C-c C-x C-i/o for time tracking study sessions.

** Chapter 1: Hibert Problems in Cybersecurity
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Theory
:DIR: ~/org/school/copyrighted/info-y124/
:END:
*** Summary
    This chapter introduces open problems in cybersecurity, inspired by Hilbert problems, based on slide-1_hibert_problems_cybersec.pdf (21 pages). It covers challenges like secure system design from inception (security by design/default) and secure composition of components. Focus on development pressures, lack of incentives, and human factors.
*** Key Concepts
    - Security by Design: Systems secure from start, evolving securely.
    - Security by Default: Capable of secure updates in response to needs.
    - Secure Composition: Integrating diverse components/services with varying security levels.
    - Challenges: Development pressure, lack of incentives, version management, human skills.
    - Component Types: OS, open-source libraries, OT systems.

         - How to design systems secure from start (security by design) and evolve them securely (security by default).
         - Few practices ensure components meet security criteria; advances in tools, languages, proofs limited.
         - Key Challenges: Development pressure (tight deadlines, security seen as costly/slow), lack of incentives (no reliable assessment methods).
         - Core Problem: Fundamental challenge in secure inception and evolution.

         :END:
         - Technical principles for secure integration of large-scale systems from diverse components/services.
         - Systems built by combining parts with varying security due to different teams/expertise.
         - Goal: Trust whole based on parts' evaluations.
         - Success Factors: Component properties, design choices, dependency management.
         - Component Types: OS, open-source libraries, OT physical systems.
         - Version Challenges: Not always latest; updates not simultaneous.
         - Human Factor: Designer/developer skills, deep system knowledge.

** Chapter 2: France Emploi Case Study
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Case Study
:DIR: ~/org/school/copyrighted/info-y124/
:END:
*** Summary
    This chapter analyzes the France Emploi (France Travail) data breach case from slide-2_france_emploi_case.pdf (15 pages). It covers the timeline of the cyber attack, CNIL fine, security weaknesses like weak password policies, and lessons on data access and authentication.
*** Key Concepts
    - Data Breach: Exfiltration of personal data from job seekers.
    - CNIL Fine: For insufficient security under GDPR.
    - Weaknesses: Excessive third-party access, weak passwords, high failed login attempts threshold.
    - Attack Methods: Identity impersonation, password reset exploitation, social engineering.
    - Investigation: Revealed multiple unrelated security issues.

         - France Travail Data Breach and CNIL Fine: Fined for insufficient data security under GDPR (reduced to half max).
         - Third party (Cap Emploi) had excessive access without safeguards; ~2,300 agents could view data via browser.
         - Compromise: One agent's account via identity impersonation, bypassing auth with password reset and social engineering.
         - Intrusion: Feb 6 – Mar 5, 2024; detected Feb 29 after activity spike.
         - Exfiltrated: 25 GB, ~36.8 million individuals (job seekers' identity, contacts, employment status/dates).
         - Investigation: Multiple weaknesses, related/unrelated to breach.

         - CNIL criticism: Min 8 chars incl. symbols — insufficient.

** Common Org-Noter Workflow for Remembering
1. Create Org: In ~/org/study/notes/crypto-notes.org, add * Slides Notes.
2. Open PDF: SPC f o slides.pdf (splits if noter active).
3. Start session: Under heading, SPC m n – PDF and Org side-by-side.
4. Annotate: In PDF, highlight text (m h), then i to insert as Org subheading with page link.
5. Add note: Type explanation under new heading for why it's key (aids memory).
6. Review: Click Org link to jump PDF; M-n to next note.
7. Close: q, then revisit later – notes recall context without reopening PDF.

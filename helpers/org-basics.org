* Org Mode Basics in Doom Emacs

** Navigation and Structure
Org files use headings (* Level 1, ** Level 2) for chapter-like separation. Your config enables pretty outlines and vim-like folding.

| Key          | Action                                      |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| =SPC m o=    | Insert new heading (after current)          |
| =TAB= / =za= | Cycle visibility (fold/unfold subtree)      |
| =SHIFT-TAB= / =zA= | Cycle global visibility (all headings)      |
| =zo=         | Unfold/open the current fold                |
| =zO=         | Unfold/show the entire subtree recursively  |
| =zc=         | Close/fold the current fold                 |
| =zC=         | Fold/hide the entire subtree recursively    |
| =zr=         | Show/unfold the next fold level (increase visibility depth) |
| =zm=         | Fold/hide the next fold level (decrease visibility depth) |
| =zR=         | Unfold/open all folds in the buffer         |
| =zM=         | Fold/close all folds in the buffer          |
| =SPC o o=    | Fuzzy jump to heading (counsel-org-goto)    |
| =SPC s i=    | Imenu sidebar for outline navigation        |
| =C-c C-n/p=  | Next/previous heading                       |
| =C-c C-f/b=  | Next/previous same-level heading            |
| =M-h=        | Promote subtree (increase level)            |
| =M-l=        | Demote subtree (decrease level)             |

** Editing and TODOs
| Key          | Action                                      |

| =C-c C-q=    | Set tags (e.g., :study:)                    |
| =C-c C-s=    | Schedule task (date/time)                   |
| =C-c C-d=    | Set deadline                                |
| =C-c C-e=    | Export (e.g., to PDF: p p)                  |
| =C-c C-a=    | Attach file (e.g., PDF)                     |
| =C-c C-l=    | Insert link (e.g., [[file:slides.pdf]])     |
| =C-c C-o=    | Open link/attachment                        |

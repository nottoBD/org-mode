2. Tag it: C-c C-q, add :study:.
3. View agenda: SPC o A s – see grouped by today/overdue.
4. Focus day: In agenda, d for day view, t to mark DONE.
5. Reschedule: s on task, pick new date for spaced review.
6. Weekly review: SPC o A a w, scan for upcoming deadlines.
7. If using habits (+habit flag): Track daily study streaks in agenda.

** Doom Emacs / Evil-specific Dired keys
| Key       | Action                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| =SPC .=   | Open Dired in current directory (project)   |
| =SPC o -= | Open Dired side panel (treemacs-like)       |
| =+=       | Create new directory                        |
| =d=       | Flag for deletion (classic Dired)           |
| =x=       | Execute flagged deletions                   |
| =SPC f d= | Doom Emacs: find file in dired              |
| =gr=      | Evil: refresh (same as =g=)                 |
| =TAB=     | Evil: toggle fold (hide/show subdirs)       |

** Useful Prefixes & Tips
- =%=       → regexp operations (mark, copy, rename)
- =*=       → mark groups (executables, directories, symlinks…)
- =C-u=     → most commands become more powerful / ask for input
- =M-x dired-do-find-regexp= → search & replace across marked files
  
** Quick Subdir Management
| Key       | Action                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| =i=       | Insert subdirectory                         |
| =k=       | Kill (remove) inserted subdirectory         |
| =$=       | Hide details (toggle long listing)          |
